Relearning to mod


I am reteaching myself how to mod using various sources including Pahimar's Lets Mod Reboot series. This mod is the result of that. As of yet, I have just about no idea what this mod will end up actually doing to the game, or whether I will ever decide to use it for anything. I appreciate all the help I can get with any issues I may encounter, and any suggestions or contributions. 

*Do note that my primary goal with this is to make a functioning mod. While keeping my code neat and clean is high on my list of priorities, it is still second to functionality. I am trying to write it neatly in the first place, but I am bound to write something messily at some point. I would appreciate it if nobody criticizes me too harshly for it when they find it :p
